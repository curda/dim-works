This is an image file uploader, for the WYSIWYG Tiny MCE. With this script you can upload images directly to your web host, and you can insert directly to the text editor. So easy to use, and totaly free. 

for install, only upload the top folder ("ibrowser") in the plugin folder and in the script to call the text editor name ibrowser. 

-This script need the GD library of PHP.-
